			<h2>My Linguistic Musings</h2>
			<p>Here I include some of my various musings on linguistics.</p>
			
			<p>Disclaimer: If you are looking for an introduction to linguistics, rather than tools for it, you can either go to my version of <a href="intro-ling/intro.html">introduction to linguistics</a>, which is in its infancy and generally added to only on-demand. For a more in-depth study of linguistics, you can go to a library (or the internet, wikipedia) and search for books using linguistic <a href="key-terms.html">key terms</a>.

			<h3>Milk and Honey</h3>
			<p>In the scriptures (The Holy Bible and The Book of Mormon), these words end up popping up together. Why do you think that is?  I like to think that it is because in persian, which may have contributed to Hebrew, the word for milk/honey is a homograph (it's like English's their/there/ and they're.) Thus, translators would have a hard time determining which was which. Indeed, ancient speakers might have even though of them as being very similar: they are both produced by a natural process, are sweet, and are indicators of life.</p>

			<p>That's all I have for now...</p>
